# Plango

## Description
This repository showcases our project **“PlanGo”** — a travel-planning application  
built with **Kotlin** (Frontend) and **Java / Spring Boot** (Backend).

## Purpose
This repository acts as a parent container for both the frontend and backend projects.  
More documents, images, and development notes will be added along the way.

## Contributors
Everyone involved in the project will be listed here as contributors.  
So far, here’s who’s building PlanGo and what they’re up to:

### **[hyunseop622](https://github.com/hyunseop622)**  
**Backend, Cloud Engineering, DB Design, DTO, UI/UX Design**  
Built most of the backend and infrastructure from scratch — including DTO design, database schema planning,  
API integration, AWS deployment, and even a bit of UI/UX design when things got too quiet on the backend side.

### **[chldnjswo](https://github.com/chldnjswo)**  
**Frontend, UI/UX Design, API Communication Testing**  
Developed the Android frontend using Kotlin, crafted clean UI/UX layouts,  
and made sure Hyunseop’s server actually talked back when the app sent a message.

## Progress
The backend has been roughly designed and is currently being expanded and refined.  
The frontend is in progress, need to be tested with server.
